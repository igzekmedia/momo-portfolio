    q: "How do I book a tattoo appointment with Momo?",

  {
    q: "Do I need to pay a deposit?",

  },
  {
    q: "How much does a tattoo cost?",
    a: "Tattoo pricing depends on size, placement, and detail. Black & grey realism and micro-realism tattoos are highly detailed and may require multiple sessions. Momo will provide a price estimate during your consultation.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I bring my own design idea?",
    a: "Absolutely. You can bring reference photos, sketches, or any inspiration you have. Momo specializes in custom designs and will adapt your idea into a unique piece of art that fits your vision and body placement.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does getting a tattoo hurt?",

  },
  {
    q: "How should I prepare for my tattoo session?",
    a: "Get a good night's sleep, eat a full meal before your appointment, and stay hydrated. Avoid alcohol or blood-thinning substances 24 hours before your session. Wear comfortable clothing that allows easy access to the area being tattooed.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a tattoo session take?",
    a: "Session length depends on the size and complexity of the tattoo. Small tattoos may take 1–2 hours, while large black & grey realism pieces can require several sessions. Momo will provide an estimated timeline during your consultation.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I take care of my tattoo afterward?",
    a: "Momo provides detailed aftercare instructions to ensure proper healing. Generally, you'll need to keep the area clean, moisturized, and protected from direct sunlight. Avoid swimming, tanning, and intense physical activity until the tattoo heals.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I get tattooed if it's my first time?",
    a: "Yes! Many of Momo's clients are first-timers. He will guide you through the process step by step, answer all your questions, and make sure you feel comfortable throughout your tattoo journey.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Momo do cover-ups or touch-ups?",
    a: "Yes, Momo offers both cover-ups and touch-ups, depending on the condition of the old tattoo and the design you want. During the consultation, he will evaluate the possibilities and create a custom plan for your new piece.",
